## OpenClaw Hook System Overview

Hooks are automation scripts that execute when specific events occur in the OpenClaw gateway.

### Hook Structure

Each hook lives in a directory with two files:

```
.openclaw/hooks/<hook-name>/
├── HOOK.md       # Metadata: events, description, enabled state
└── handler.ts    # TypeScript implementation
```

### Available Events

| Event | When it fires |
|-------|--------------|
| `command:new` | A new command is received |
| `command:reset` | A command is reset |
| `command:stop` | A command is stopped |
| `message:received` | A message is received from the user |
| `message:sent` | A message is sent by the agent |
| `message:transcribed` | A voice message is transcribed |
| `session:compact:before` | Before session compaction |
| `session:compact:after` | After session compaction |
| `session:patch` | Session state is patched |

### HOOK.md Format

```markdown
---
name: hook-name
description: "What this hook does"
events: ["command:new"]
enabled: true
emoji: "🛡️"
---
```

### handler.ts Format

```typescript
const handler = async (event) => {
  if (event.type !== "command" || event.action !== "new") {
    return;
  }
  // warn the user:
  event.messages.push('⚠️ Warning: reason');
  // Note: do not throw — it prevents other handlers from running
};
export default handler;
```

Available on `event`: `type`, `action`, `sessionKey`, `timestamp`, `messages` (push strings to notify user), `context` (event-specific data)

### CLI Commands

```bash
openclaw hooks list              # list all hooks
openclaw hooks enable <name>     # enable a hook
openclaw hooks disable <name>    # disable a hook
openclaw hooks info <name>       # view hook details
openclaw hooks check             # verify hook eligibility
```
